# Miners üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Miners are all devices that are connected to the server and contributing their computing power to the grid. Miners are made of low power micro controllers like Arduino or ESP.

The main function of a miner is to be connected and available to pickup any task that is given by the server for execution.

Once the task is executed, miner returns results back to the server for validation.

Even though the focus of this project is to enable iot devices to participate, all platforms are welcome and can benefit the overall system by providing computational power. The more miners there are, the more powerful the GridShell is.
