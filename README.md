With billions of IOT devices connected today there is a massive potential of computing power ready for use at minimal or even zero cost. These tiny computers are capable of operating on renewable energies like solar power, giving tremendous opportunities for utilizing their computing capabilities without impacting environment.

GridShell is IOT powered and people enabled network of low power devices, that combined together provide distributed computational power of millions of processors that in vast majority idle during their lifetime.
  
  GridShell is leveraging existing iot devices. A single library allows sensors, light bulbs, smart socket, routers, unused micro-controllers and lots of other devices, to connect together and contribute for the overall grid growth. If your sketch is mostly idling, or has some free time - join your project to GridShell in a one-minute effort.
  
  In the current stage, GridShell is in early development phase - thank You for any contribution made !
