 # Miners
 
For a grid system to work, there have to be devices that can actually do the work - in GridShell we call them miners.
The work they do is computing, they get some data and they compute output - this is the main task of each miner in the grid.

We call them miners because they mine value for the project owners who submit computation tasks and use GridShell computational power to perform
calculations and get valuable output.

The GridShell is made to enable low-power devices like ESP and Arudino to contribute their processors to the Grid.
Miners made of these devices are very cheap and consume low energy. Some of them can be powered by solar panels, making
their computational power available totally for free.

Each miner connected is adding up to a total computational power of the GridShell system. 
The more miners are available at current time, the faster the computation of the output of a project is.

We have connected miners made of temperature sensors, smart wall sockets, smart bulbs and even home WiFi routers.
These devices are mostly idling, turned into GridShell miners they contribute their idling time (99%) to the overall Grid power 
that can be used at any time for running valuable computations.

Some of the GridShell miners are calculating important values like average air quality indexes for hundreths of online sensors every hour.
